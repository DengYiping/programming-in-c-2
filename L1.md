# C Preprocessor
Before compilation, C source files are being preprocessed.
The preprocessor replaces tokens by an arbitrary number of characters.

## Frequent usage
 - Use of named constants
 - Include files
 - Conditional compilation
 - Macro argument

## include macro
`#include` will simply insert the file into the c file.

Library include: `#include <stdio.h>`
Local include: `#include "myheader.h"`

## define macro

`#define NAME SUBSTITUTION` is the syntax

Examples:
```
#define MAX(A, B) ((A) > (B) ? (A) : (B))
```

Note: Always use bracket in the macro. Example:
```
#define SQARE(A) A*A

SQARE(5 + 1) // will evaluate to 11

#define SQARE(A) (A)*(A)

SQARE(5 + 1) // will evaluate to 36
```
