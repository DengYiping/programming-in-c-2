# C Preprocessor
Before compilation, C source files are being preprocessed.
The preprocessor replaces tokens by an arbitrary number of characters.

## Frequent usage
 - Use of named constants
 - Include files
 - Conditional compilation
 - Macro argument

## Macro Syntax
`#include` will simply insert the file into the c file.

Library include: `#include <stdio.h>`
Local include: `#include "myheader.h"`
