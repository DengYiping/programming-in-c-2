# Operations with Files

## Open a file
### Standard Stream
 - `stdin` is the standard input.
 - `stdout` is where program writes its output data
 - `stderr` is where program writes error.

### File Mode
 - Text stream: sequence of characters logically organized in line. Lines are terminated by a newline `\n`
 - Binary stream: sequence of raw bytes
## Opening a file
```
FILE* fopen(const char* name, const char* mode);
```
File mode string
 - `r` open for reading. at the beginning.
 - `r+` open for reading and writing. Positions at the beginning.
 - `w` Open for writing. Truncate if exists. Positions at the beginning.
 - `w+` Open for reading and writing. Truncate if exists. Positions at the the beginning.
 - `a` Open for appending. Does not truncate if exists. Positions at the end.
 - `a+` Open for appending and writing. Does not truncate if exists. Reading by default is at the beginning. Writing is done at the end.

## Reading & Writing a file
 - `int getc(FILE* fp)` return the next char
 - `int putc(int c, FILE* fp)` write a char to fp
 - `int fscanf(FILE* fp, *format, ...)` gets data from fp
 - `fprintf(FILE* fp, *format, ...)` insert data into the file

### `getc()` and `putc()`
```
char ch;
ch = getc(fp);
putc(ch, fp);
```
### EOF
Program needs to stop when it reaches end of file. `getc()` returns special value of EOF,
when trying to read character but reached end of file.
### fflush(), feof(), ferror()
### fseek() and ftell()

## Close a file
```
FILE* fprt;
fptr = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");
if(fptr == NULL){
    fprintf(stderr, "Cannot open file!\n");
    exit(1);
}
fclose(fptr);
```
