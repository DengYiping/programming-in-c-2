# function pointers
A pointer may not just point to a variable, but may also point to a function.
In the program it is assumed that the function does what it has to do and you use it in your program as if it was there.
The decision which function will actually be called is determined at run-time.

## Example
a function pointer that points to function that takes int and return void
```
void (*foo)(int);
void* (*foo)(int);
int (*foo_array[2])(int);
typedef int (*foo_ptr_t)(int);
foo_ptr_t foo_ptr_arr[3];
```

## Makefile
Comments start with `#`

Macro start with
```
OBJ = obj1.o obj2.o
```
Use macro, you have
```
$(OBJ)
```

Makefile Explicit file
```
target: source1 [source2] [source3]
    command1
    [command2]
    [command3]
```
